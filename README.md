HTML Structure:
The HTML structure defines a container (div) with the class valentines-container, containing an image of Hello Kitty, a text message asking to be someone's Valentine, and two buttons labeled "YES" and "NO".

CSS Styling:
The CSS styles ensure that the content is centered both horizontally and vertically on the page. The valentines-container class ensures that the content inside it is centered horizontally.
